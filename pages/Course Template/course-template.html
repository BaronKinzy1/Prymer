                    <h3>1. Lipolysis</h3>
                    <p>Hydrolysis of ester bonds in lipids (Lipolysis) may occur by enzyme action or heat and moisture resulting in the
                    liberation of free fatty acids. Free fatty acids are virtually absent in the fat of living animal tissue. They can be
                    formed, however, by enzyme action after the animal is killed; hence rendering processes are necessary to inactivate the
                    enzymes by heat treatment</p>
            <br>
                    <h4>Base catalyzed hydrolysis</h4>
                    <p>Saponification is the term used to designate base â€“ catalyzed ester hydrolysis. This reaction between fat or oil and
                    NaOH or KOH leads to hydrolysis of the former leading to the formation of soap and glycerol.</p>

                    <h4>Transesterification of fats</h4>
                    <p>Fats can be converted into methyl esters of carboxylic acids by allowing triacylglycerol to react with methanol in the
                    presence of a basic or acidic catalyst.
                    The mixture of the methyl esters formed can be separated by fractional distillation which can be hydrolyzed to
                    individual carboxylic acids of high purity.
                    This is thus, the source of straight chain acids of even carbon number ranging from six to 18 carbons</p>

                    <h4>Autoxidation</h4>
                    <p>Lipid oxidation is one of the major causes of food spoilage. It is of a great concern because it makes edible oils and
                    fat containing food to develop various off-flavour and off-odours called rancid. In addition, it can also decrease
                    the nutritional quality of food while some oxidation products are potentially toxic. On the other hand, some oxidation
                    reactions are desirable because they lead to the production of aromas in some fried foods. In foods, the lipids can be
                    oxidized by both enzyme and nonenzymic mechanisms. Hydroperoxides which are the primary initial products of lipid
                    auto-oxidation are relatively unstable. They enter into numerous and complex breakdown and interaction mechanism
                    responsible for the production of compounds which are of biological significant as well as impartation of flavour.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Factors influencing the rate of Lipid oxidation</h4>


                   <ul>
                    <li>1. Fatty Acid Composition: The number, position and geometry of double bond affect the rate of oxidation. For
                        example,
                        the oxidation for arachidonic, linolenic, linoleic, and oleic are approximately 40: 20: 10: 1, respectively. Cis
                        acids
                        oxidize more readily than their trans isomers, and conjugated double bonds are more reactive than non- conjugated.
                        Oxidation of saturated fatty acids is extremely slow, at room temperature.</li>
                    
                    <li>2. Oxygen concentration: When the supply of oxygen is unlimited, the rate of lipid oxidation is independent of
                        oxygen
                        pressure, but in limited quantity, the higher the pressure, the higher the rate of oxidation i.e. rate of oxidation
                        is
                        directly proportional to oxygen pressure. The effect of oxygen pressure on the rate is influenced by other factors,
                        such
                        as temperature and surface area.</li>
                    <li>
                        3. Moisture: The rate of oxidation also depends on water activity. In dried foods with low moisture content i.e. aw
                        < 0.1, oxidation proceeds at rapid rate. If the aw is about 0.3, the rate will be reduced to minimum. This also has
                            to do with catalytic activity of metal catalyst, by quenching free radicals, by promoting non-enzymic browning
                            which in turn produced compounds with antioxidant activities. At higher water activities (aw=0.55 - 0.85), the
                            rate increases again, which was presumed to be due to increase in mobilization of the catalyst present. </li>
                    
                            
                    <li>
                        4. Temperature: The rate of oxidation increases with increase in temperature. As temperature increases, the increase
                        in
                        rate with increasing oxygen concentration is insignificant, because oxygen becomes less soluble as the temperature
                        is
                        raised.
                    </li>
                   </ul>
